# James Brodovsky

Hi there! My name is James and I am a robotics engineer based out of Philadelphia, PA. I have a B.S. and M.S. in mechanical engineering and my robotics skill set is in the relams of autonomous navigation, kinetic and kinematic analysis, motion control, and route and trajectory planning. My professional interests lie in using unmanned ground and air vehicles to automate difficult, dirty, and dangerous tasks that most people don't want to do. I believe that robotic technology really does have the potential to bring about the wonderful futures we see in science fiction. 

Currently, I am working as a Research and Development Engineer for the Pennsylvania State University Applied Research Lab. I work with a research team that investigates how particle filters may be used to aid marine navigation. We use particle filters and various sensors to localize ships on bathymetric and gravimetric maps of the Earth with future applications to come.

Specifically, I have skills and experience in the following areas:
* 2D and 3D:
  * Robotic route planning and navigation
  * Kinetic and kinematic analysis
  * Motion control
* Autonomous localization and state estimation using Bayesian and Monte Carlo techniques (including standard, extended, and unscented Kalman Filters, and Particle Filters).
* Software development using C++, Python, ROS, and Matlab on Windows and Linux Ubuntu
* Version control with Git through SourceTree, VS Code, and GitHub Desktop
* Object recognition and classification using Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, and Computer Vision
* Mechanical design
  * 2D & 3D CAD
  * Geometric Dimensioning and Tollerancing (GD&T)
  * Design for manufacturability and fabrication
* 2D and 3D rigid body dynamic simulation and analysis
* Synthetic dataset generation for Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence training
